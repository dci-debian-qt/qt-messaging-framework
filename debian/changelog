qmf (1.0~2010w23-2) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * Add qmf-tests package and ship the tests.
    Disable 01_disable_test_benchmarks.diff patch.
  * Add 04_no_rpath_tests_benchmarks.diff to remove rpath from tests and
    benchmarks.
  * Merge qmf-messageserver and libmessageserver1 packages.
    It doesn't make sense to ship them separately.
