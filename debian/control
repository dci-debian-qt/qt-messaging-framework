Description: Qt Messaging Framework (QMF) message server support library
 The Qt Messaging Framework, QMF, consists of a C++ library and daemon server
 process that can be used to build email clients, and more generally software
 that interacts with email and mail servers.
 .
 The MessageServer application is a daemon, designed to run continuously while
 providing services to client applications. It provides messaging transport
 functionality, communicating with external servers on behalf of Messaging
 Framework client applications. New types of messaging (such as Instant
 Messages or video messages) can be handled by the server application without
 modification to existing client applications.
 .
 This package contains:
  * the message server support library. It provides assistance in developing
    GUI clients that access messaging data.
  * a server application supporting multiple messaging transport mechanisms.

Description: Qt Messaging Framework (QMF) client library
 The Qt Messaging Framework, QMF, consists of a C++ library and daemon server
 process that can be used to build email clients, and more generally software
 that interacts with email and mail servers.
 .
 The Client library provides classes giving access to all messages stored on
 the device, via a uniform interface. It simplifies the task of creating
 messaging client applications, and permits other Messaging Framework
 applications to interact with messaging data where appropriate. New types of
 messages can be supported by the library without modification to existing
 client applications.
 .
 This package contains a library for developing applications that work with
 messages.
